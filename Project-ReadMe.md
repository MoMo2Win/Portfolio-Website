# Portfolio Project

Here I'll be creating my personal portfolio project, based on what i've learnt throughout this month from learning North Metro Tafe.

### Learnt Components for web development
- html
- css
- javasript
- tailwindCSS
- Api Calls
- FTP


Throughout the program i mainly used tailwindCSS to complete my portfolio and make quick designs. There's really not much in it, as i went for minimalistic theme cause I like to keep it simple and neat.

### Color Scheme
This is the color Scheme that ill be using to create this portfolio.
